help me make html and python for a flash website related to people driving cars and parking

Make a better model for the cars

make it a realistic car please and add parking spots
the cars are not realistic enough and make the cars turnable
Make the wheels on the side of the car and not on the top of the car. Make obstacles

make cars have collision and crash upon impact
make cars explode and then put game over screen for the player with replay option, make the obstacles have a larger hitbox so that the cars wont phase through them.
make the obstacle hitbox the size of its size, and make a new level with bigger map, new cars, more obstacles, (people included)Can you fix it so the cars are not spawning inside of eachother so that the player is softlocked from playing 
obstacles are spawning inside the cars, making them glitched
make realistic car with windows and wheels on the side
Make the humans have human models, remove windows of cars and put one window on the front.
